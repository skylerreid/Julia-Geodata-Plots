# Julia-Geodata-Plots
A collection of Julia programs for plotting data over country/state/county outlines extracted from shapefiles. A folder for each project contains the Julia code and the corresponding SHP+SHX files.

Note about filepaths: in general, the data and shapefile included in the folders do not have to be in the same directory on your machine. HOWEVER, the .shp and the .shx file with the same name must be in the same directory.
